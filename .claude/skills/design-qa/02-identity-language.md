# B) Identity + Language

Purpose: Enforce trust, terminology, and defensible claims.

Canonical terms:
- Merchant: authenticated business account
- Retailer: consumer-facing storefront
- Source/Feed: technical price origin

Banned language:
- best, optimal, recommended, buy now, guaranteed
- deal scores, rankings, urgency language
- AI as a primary value claim

If language implies authority the system cannot enforce, it is a blocker.
