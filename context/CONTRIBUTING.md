# Contributing

This repository is primarily maintained by a small core team.

Contributions are welcome, but the bar for changes—especially to documentation—is clarity, accuracy, and alignment with existing constraints.

---

## General Guidelines

- Prefer small, focused changes.
- Do not introduce new promises, guarantees, or scope without discussion.
- Keep language factual and conservative.
- If unsure where something belongs, ask before adding a new document.

---

## Documentation Changes

- High-authority documents (e.g. public promises, scope, release criteria) should not be edited casually.
- If a document becomes outdated, archive it rather than rewriting it in place.
- New documents must have a clear purpose and location.

---

## Code Changes

Code contributions should align with documented behavior and constraints.
If code behavior diverges from documentation, documentation should be updated **only after** behavior is enforced.

## Final Note

This file exists to set expectations, not to slow anyone down.

When in doubt: prioritize correctness over completeness.
