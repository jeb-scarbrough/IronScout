# ADR-008: No Usage-Based Billing UI in v1

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Usage-based billing increases complexity and dispute risk in v1.

## Decision
Merchant billing is subscription-based only. Usage metrics are internal and not exposed.

## Alternatives Considered
- Usage-based billing
- Hybrid billing

## Consequences
Simpler billing at the cost of pricing granularity.

## Notes
May be revisited post-v1.
