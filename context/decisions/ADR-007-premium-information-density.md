# ADR-007: Premium Increases Information Density, Not Guarantees

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Paid tiers risk being interpreted as better outcomes or guarantees.

## Decision
Premium unlocks more context, speed, and control but does not change guarantees or correctness.

- Outcome-based premium claims
- Recommendation-based premium

## Consequences
Clear pricing and reduced disputes.

## Notes
Governs pricing language and feature gating.
