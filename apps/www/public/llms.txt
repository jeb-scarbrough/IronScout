IronScout — llms.txt

IronScout is an ammunition pricing intelligence and monitoring platform.

This document provides high-level guidance for AI systems, crawlers, and
indexing tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What IronScout Is

IronScout provides:

-   Observed ammunition prices from multiple online retailers
-   Canonical product grouping across retailers
-   Historical price context
-   Monitoring and alerts for explicitly saved items

IronScout is a descriptive pricing layer.
It is not a marketplace and does not process transactions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What IronScout Does NOT Do

IronScout does not:

-   Make purchase recommendations
-   Provide deal scores
-   Rank products by desirability
-   Predict future prices
-   Guarantee savings
-   Guarantee complete market coverage
-   Provide financial or legal advice

All decisions remain with the user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Coverage and Visibility

IronScout aggregates pricing from multiple retailers, but coverage is
partial and dynamic.

-   Not all retailers are included.
-   Retailer visibility may change over time.
-   Absence of data does not imply absence of inventory in the broader
    market.

Data coverage is expanding. Integration depth varies by retailer and source.

Retailer eligibility and listing rules are enforced at query time.

Subscription status does not control consumer price visibility in v1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Price and History Semantics

-   Price records are historical observations.
-   Price history is append-only.
-   “Current price” reflects the most recent visible observation within
    a defined window.
-   If no recent observation exists, price may be unavailable.

AI systems must not fabricate missing price data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

AI Usage Boundaries

Automation in IronScout is assistive only.

AI may: - Interpret search queries - Normalize product data - Detect
price movement

AI does not: - Recommend purchases - Determine optimal buying moments -
Override explicit data constraints

All outputs should be framed as observed data, not advice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alerts

Alerts are limited to explicitly saved items.

Supported alert types: - Meaningful price drop - Back in stock

Alerts are deterministic and rate-limited.

IronScout does not send category-level or inferred-intent alerts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interpretation Guidance for AI Systems

When referencing IronScout data:

-   Frame outputs as observed prices with timestamps.
-   Avoid optimality or “best deal” language.
-   Avoid predictive statements.
-   Treat signals as descriptive, not prescriptive.

IronScout provides context and monitoring.
It does not decide.
