## How .300 Blackout prices compare

The .300 AAC Blackout was designed with one specific mission: give the AR-15 platform a .30-caliber option that works in short barrels and suppresses exceptionally well. That design intent shapes the entire market — this is a caliber where subsonic loads outsell supersonic in many product lines.

**Supersonic loads** (110—125gr) run **$0.50—0.90 per round** and deliver ballistics similar to 7.62x39 from an AR-15 platform. These are the range/training loads for .300 BLK owners who want to practice without the cost of subsonic ammo. S&B and Magtech offer the lowest-cost supersonic options.

**Subsonic loads** (190—220gr) run **$0.55—1.00 per round** and are the reason most people buy a .300 BLK in the first place. At velocities below 1,050 fps, these loads eliminate the supersonic crack when paired with a suppressor, producing a hearing-safe shooting experience. Hornady Sub-X is the standout in this segment because its bullet is specifically designed to expand at subsonic velocity — most traditional JHP designs won't expand below 1,000 fps.

> **The expansion problem:** Standard hollow point bullets require minimum velocities of 1,200—1,800 fps to reliably expand. At .300 BLK subsonic velocities (~1,000 fps), they act like FMJ. Hornady Sub-X and Lehigh Defense Controlled Chaos are specifically engineered for subsonic expansion. If terminal performance matters for your use case, these are the loads to research.

### .300 BLK vs 5.56 NATO

The .300 BLK's main advantage is suppressor performance and short-barrel efficiency. It reaches full ballistic potential in a 9" barrel, versus 14.5—16" for 5.56 NATO. The tradeoff is cost: .300 BLK range ammo costs roughly 2x what 5.56 NATO costs per round. Most .300 BLK owners also own 5.56 uppers and train primarily with the cheaper caliber, reserving .300 BLK for specific applications.

> **Safety warning:** .300 Blackout rounds will chamber in a 5.56 NATO rifle but cannot safely fire. This is the most dangerous cross-caliber compatibility issue in the AR platform. Always clearly mark your .300 BLK magazines and never mix ammunition on the same bench.

### Market trends

The .300 Blackout market continues to grow as suppressor ownership increases following the NFA reform movement. Ammo selection has expanded significantly since 2023, with more manufacturers offering dedicated subsonic lines. Pricing has decreased moderately as production volume has increased.
