## How .300 Blackout prices compare

The .300 Blackout commands a premium over 5.56 NATO due to lower production volume and heavier projectiles. Supersonic FMJ range ammo runs $0.50–0.75 per round. Subsonic loads (the primary reason most people own this caliber) run $0.55–0.90 per round. Premium hunting and defense loads with expanding bullets exceed $1.00 per round. This caliber uses standard AR-15 lower receivers with only a barrel swap, making it popular for suppressed shooting.
