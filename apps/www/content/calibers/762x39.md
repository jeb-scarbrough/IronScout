## How 7.62x39 prices compare

The 7.62x39 is one of the cheapest rifle calibers thanks to massive global production of steel-cased ammunition. Steel-case FMJ (Tula, Wolf, Barnaul) runs $0.22–0.30 per round. Brass-cased options (Federal, Norma) run $0.35–0.50 per round but are required at many indoor ranges. Note that Russian ammo imports were banned in 2021, so current steel-case supply comes from existing inventory and non-Russian manufacturers. Brass-cased options have become more important as a result. Expanding bullet options are limited compared to 5.56/.308.
