## How 7.62x39 prices compare

The 7.62x39mm is defined by two realities: it's the cheapest intermediate rifle cartridge available thanks to massive global production, and its market was fundamentally reshaped by the 2022 Russian ammunition import ban.

**Steel-case FMJ** remains the bread and butter of the 7.62x39 market. Tula, Wolf, and Red Army Standard — all originally sourced from Russian factories — run **$0.22–0.32 per round**. Since the import ban, existing inventory has been slowly depleting while non-Russian sources (primarily Serbian and Bosnian production under various brands) have partially backfilled the supply. Prices remain higher than the pre-ban era when Russian steel-case regularly dipped below $0.20/rd.

**Brass-case FMJ** from PMC (South Korea) and S&B (Czech Republic) runs **$0.35–0.50/rd** and serves shooters who need brass for indoor ranges that prohibit steel-case, or for those who want to reload (though 7.62x39 reloading is uncommon). The brass-case premium is significant — roughly 50–80% more per round than steel-case.

**Hunting ammunition** is a thin segment. Federal Fusion and Hornady Black SST are the two serious hunting options at **$0.60–0.80/rd**. The 7.62x39's moderate velocity and limited bullet selection make it best suited for deer-sized game inside 200 yards.

> **Range restrictions:** Many indoor ranges prohibit steel-case and/or bi-metal jacket ammunition. Most steel-case 7.62x39 uses a bi-metal jacket (steel and copper). If your range magnet-tests ammo, you'll need brass-case PMC or S&B. Verify before buying in bulk.

### Market trends

The 7.62x39 market continues to adjust to the Russian import ban. Non-Russian steel-case production has increased but hasn't fully replaced the lost volume. Pricing is stable but elevated compared to pre-2022 levels. The caliber remains popular due to the enormous installed base of AK-pattern rifles and SKS carbines.
