## How 5.56 NATO prices compare

5.56 NATO is the highest-volume rifle cartridge in the U.S. market, driven by the enormous installed base of AR-15 platform rifles. The two standard military loads — **M193 (55gr FMJ)** and **M855 (62gr green tip)** — anchor the price floor for the caliber.

M193-spec ammunition from PMC, Wolf Gold, and Federal American Eagle typically runs **$0.28–0.42 per round** depending on manufacturer and quantity. The lowest per-round prices consistently come from bulk purchases of 500–1,000 rounds in the $0.28–0.33/rd range. M855 green tip runs a small premium over M193, typically $0.02–0.05/rd more due to the steel penetrator core and slightly more complex manufacturing.

> **Chamber compatibility:** 5.56 NATO is loaded to higher pressure than .223 Remington. 5.56 ammunition is safe in 5.56 NATO and .223 Wylde chambers, but you should verify your barrel chamber before shooting 5.56 in a rifle marked .223 Remington only. Most modern AR-15s are chambered in 5.56 or .223 Wylde.

### Match-grade and precision loads

The match-grade segment starts at **$0.70/rd** and ranges up to $1.20+ for premium options. The standard competition and precision loads are 69gr, 75gr, and 77gr OTM/BTHP bullets — Sierra MatchKing and Hornady ELD Match are the dominant bullet choices. Federal Gold Medal Match 77gr SMK is widely considered the gold standard for AR-15 precision at distance, but Hornady Black 75gr BTHP offers comparable accuracy at a lower price point.

For shooters building an AR for both home defense and range use, the 75gr–77gr OTM loads serve double duty: they shoot sub-MOA in a quality barrel and offer superior terminal performance compared to M193 or M855 at typical defensive distances.

### 5.56 vs .223 pricing

Ammunition labeled ".223 Remington" is often slightly cheaper than 5.56 NATO-spec ammo because it can be loaded to lower pressures with less quality assurance overhead. In practice, Wolf Gold (labeled .223) and PMC X-TAC M193 (labeled 5.56) are both loaded to similar performance levels and often come from the same factories. For most shooters in 5.56 or .223 Wylde chambers, either works identically at the range.

### Market trends

The 5.56 NATO market is well-supplied as of early 2026, with domestic production from Federal, Winchester, and Hornady supplemented by imports from PMC (South Korea), IMI (Israel), and various Eastern European producers. Pricing has been stable since late 2024, with the best bulk deals consistently hovering around $0.28–0.32/rd for brass-cased FMJ.
