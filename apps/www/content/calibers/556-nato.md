## How 5.56 NATO prices compare

The 5.56 NATO market is the highest-volume rifle caliber. M193 (55gr FMJ) and M855 (62gr green tip) are the two standard loads — M193 is typically slightly cheaper. Bulk prices for either run $0.28–0.42 per round depending on manufacturer and quantity. Match-grade loads (77gr SMK/OTM) jump to $0.80+ per round. Note that 5.56 NATO is higher pressure than .223 Remington — 5.56 is safe in .223 Wylde and 5.56 chambers, but check your barrel before shooting 5.56 in a .223 Remington chamber.
