## How 6.5 Creedmoor prices compare

The 6.5 Creedmoor is the fastest-growing rifle cartridge of the past decade, and that popularity has driven prices down significantly from its early premium positioning. Match-grade 140gr loads (ELD-M, Sierra MatchKing) run $0.85–1.20 per round. Hunting loads with controlled-expansion bullets run $0.90–1.30 per round. Budget range ammo with BTHP bullets starts around $0.70 per round. The 6.5 CM offers noticeably better ballistics than .308 Winchester past 500 yards with less recoil, which is why competitive shooters have largely switched.
