## How 6.5 Creedmoor prices compare

The 6.5 Creedmoor was purpose-designed by Hornady in 2007 for long-range precision shooting, and it has since become the fastest-growing rifle caliber in America. Its combination of high ballistic coefficient, moderate recoil, and excellent accuracy in factory rifles has made it the default recommendation for shooters moving beyond 5.56 into precision work.

**Range and training ammo** is a smaller segment than you'd find with .308 Winchester — most 6.5 CM shooters buy at least mid-grade ammunition. S&B and Hornady American Gunner offer the most affordable practice options at **$0.80–1.20/rd**. Even the budget options shoot surprisingly well, typically producing sub-MOA groups in a quality rifle.

**Match-grade ammunition** is where 6.5 Creedmoor truly excels. Hornady ELD Match 140gr and Federal Gold Medal Match 140gr run **$1.10–1.60/rd** and consistently produce 0.5 MOA or better in modern precision rifles. This is the segment that built the caliber's reputation — factory match ammo that shoots like handloads.

**Hunting ammunition** has expanded significantly as the caliber has grown. The 6.5 Creedmoor is adequate for deer and antelope at any reasonable range, and with proper bullet selection (bonded or monolithic) it handles elk-sized game at moderate distances. Hornady ELD-X and Federal Terminal Ascent are the most popular hunting loads at **$1.20–2.00/rd**.

> **The 6.5 Creedmoor vs .308 question:** For precision shooting beyond 400 yards, the 6.5 CM is objectively superior: less wind drift, less drop, and less recoil. For hunting inside 300 yards, the .308 offers more bullet energy and a wider selection of budget hunting loads. Most serious precision shooters have moved to 6.5 CM; most hunters still reach for .308 or .30-06. Both are excellent cartridges.

### Market trends

The 6.5 Creedmoor market continues to grow, with every major manufacturer now offering comprehensive product lines. Pricing has stabilized and actually decreased slightly for match-grade loads as competition has increased. The caliber has firmly established itself as the standard precision rifle cartridge for both competition and recreational long-range shooting.
