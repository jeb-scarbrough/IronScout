## How 9mm prices compare

9mm Luger is the highest-volume handgun caliber sold in the United States, and that volume drives the most competitive pricing in the handgun market. FMJ range ammunition from major manufacturers — Blazer Brass, Magtech, Federal American Eagle, Winchester White Box — typically runs **$0.17–0.25 per round** in standard 50-round boxes. Buying in case quantities of 500–1,000 rounds typically saves 10–15% over box pricing, putting bulk FMJ in the $0.15–0.20/rd range from the best deals.

Premium hollow point ammunition for concealed carry and home defense is a different market entirely. The top-tier duty loads — Federal HST, Speer Gold Dot, Hornady Critical Duty — run **$0.55–1.00 per round** in 20–25 round boxes. These are purpose-built for consistent expansion and barrier penetration, and the price premium reflects both the engineering and the smaller production runs. Mid-tier defense options like Sig V-Crown and Federal Punch offer solid terminal performance at $0.50–0.70/rd, making them attractive for shooters who want reliable JHP without the law enforcement premium.

> **Buying tip:** The price difference between 9mm FMJ brands is often just $0.01–0.03/rd. At those margins, shipping cost and availability matter as much as sticker price. Watch for free shipping thresholds — most retailers offer free shipping at $99–$150, which works out to roughly 500–750 rounds of FMJ.

### 9mm market trends

Prices have stabilized since the post-pandemic normalization of 2023–2024. The 9mm market reached a floor in mid-2024 and has remained steady, with occasional promotional dips. Steel-cased imports (Tula, Wolf) continue to provide a budget option at $0.14–0.18/rd, though availability has been inconsistent since the 2022 Russian import restrictions. Brass-cased domestic production from CCI/Blazer and Federal dominates the range ammo segment.

### What to buy for range vs. carry

For **range and training**, 115gr FMJ is the universal standard. Virtually every manufacturer makes one, and they all perform similarly. Choose based on price and availability — you will not notice a meaningful accuracy difference between Blazer Brass and Federal American Eagle at typical handgun distances.

For **concealed carry and home defense**, 124gr and 147gr JHP loads are the standard. The 124gr +P segment (Federal HST 124gr +P, Speer Gold Dot 124gr +P) represents the most common law enforcement duty load configuration, which means it has the deepest real-world performance data. However, standard-pressure 124gr and 147gr loads from these same manufacturers perform well in modern designs and generate less felt recoil — a meaningful consideration for compact and subcompact pistols.
