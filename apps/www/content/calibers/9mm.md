## How 9mm prices compare

The 9mm market is the highest-volume handgun caliber in the US. FMJ range ammo typically runs $0.17–0.25 per round in bulk quantities (500–1000 rounds). Premium hollow points for carry run $0.50–1.00 per round. Prices have been relatively stable since mid-2024 after the post-pandemic normalization. Buying in case quantities (1000 rounds) typically saves 10–15% over 50-round boxes.
