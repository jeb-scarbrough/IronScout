## How .380 ACP prices compare

The .380 ACP is the most popular micro-compact carry caliber. FMJ range ammo runs $0.22–0.35 per round — noticeably more than 9mm despite the smaller cartridge, because production volumes are lower. JHP defense loads run $0.50–0.90 per round. Federal HST Micro and Hornady Critical Defense are the two most recommended carry loads due to their design for short barrels. The .380 ACP is essentially a shorter 9mm case — same bullet diameter (.355"), less powder, less recoil.
