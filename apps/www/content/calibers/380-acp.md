## .380 ACP by bullet type

- [.380 ACP FMJ / Range ammo](/caliber/380-acp/fmj) — Full metal jacket training and practice loads
- [.380 ACP Hollow Point / JHP](/caliber/380-acp/hollow-point) — Expanding defense loads designed for short barrels

## How .380 ACP prices compare

The .380 ACP exists in a pricing paradox: it uses less material than 9mm but costs more per round due to lower production volume. FMJ range ammo runs **$0.22—0.34 per round** — noticeably more than 9mm FMJ despite being a smaller, less powerful cartridge. This is entirely a volume economics issue: 9mm production dwarfs .380 ACP, driving 9mm prices lower.

Premium JHP defense loads run **$0.50—1.00 per round**, comparable to 9mm JHP pricing. The critical difference is that .380 ACP operates at lower velocities from shorter barrels, which makes reliable bullet expansion more challenging. Federal HST Micro and Hornady Critical Defense FTX are specifically engineered for .380 velocities and short-barreled pocket pistols — they expand more reliably than standard JHP designs at .380 velocities.

> **The .380 vs 9mm debate:** Modern micro-compact 9mm pistols (Sig P365, Springfield Hellcat, S&W Shield Plus) have largely eroded the .380's traditional advantage of smaller gun size. Today's .380 pocket pistols are only marginally smaller than micro-9mm options while costing more to feed and delivering less terminal performance. The .380 remains relevant for shooters who are recoil-sensitive or who prefer the smallest possible carry guns — the Ruger LCP and similar true pocket pistols have no 9mm equivalent at that size.

### Market trends

The .380 ACP market is stable but not growing. New gun sales in .380 have declined as micro-compact 9mm pistols have captured most of the concealed carry market. Pricing is steady, and all major manufacturers maintain full product lines.
