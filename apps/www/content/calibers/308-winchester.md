## How .308 Winchester prices compare

The .308 Winchester is the standard full-power rifle round. FMJ/ball ammo for range use typically runs $0.55–0.75 per round. Match-grade loads (168gr–175gr BTHP/OTM) run $0.80–1.30 per round. Hunting loads with expanding bullets fall between. The 7.62x51 NATO military equivalent is dimensionally similar but loaded to slightly lower pressure — safe to shoot in .308 chambers. Buying bulk (200+ rounds) saves significantly over 20-round boxes.
