## How .308 Winchester prices compare

The .308 Winchester occupies a unique position in the rifle market: it's the most popular full-power .30-caliber cartridge, serving equally well for hunting, precision shooting, and general-purpose rifle work. That versatility is reflected in one of the broadest price ranges of any caliber.

**FMJ range and training ammo** runs **$0.55—0.75 per round** for brass-cased loads from Federal American Eagle, PMC, and S&B. This is roughly 2x the cost of 5.56 NATO FMJ, which is the main reason many AR-platform shooters train with 5.56 and save the .308 for specific applications. Surplus and imported 7.62 NATO ball can occasionally dip below $0.50/rd, but availability is inconsistent.

**Hunting ammunition** represents the broadest segment, ranging from **$0.85 to $2.50+ per round** depending on bullet technology. Budget hunting loads — Federal Power-Shok, Remington Core-Lokt, Winchester Super-X — use traditional cup-and-core bullets and run $0.85—1.30/rd. Premium bonded and controlled-expansion bullets (Hornady ELD-X, Nosler AccuBond, Barnes TTSX) command $1.40—2.50/rd, with lead-free options like Barnes at the top of the range.

> **The 168gr vs 175gr question:** For match shooters, the traditional choice was 168gr Sierra MatchKing. At distances beyond 800 yards, the 175gr SMK and Hornady 178gr ELD-M maintain supersonic flight longer, giving them an edge at extended range. For most hunters and precision shooters inside 600 yards, either works well.

### .308 vs 7.62 NATO

The .308 Winchester and 7.62x51mm NATO share the same external case dimensions but differ in chamber pressure specifications and brass thickness. In practice, commercial .308 Winchester ammunition is safe in 7.62 NATO chambers and vice versa for modern rifles. Military surplus 7.62 NATO tends to be loaded slightly milder than commercial .308, making it a lower-cost training option when available.

### Market trends

The .308 Winchester market is mature and well-supplied. Domestic production from Federal, Hornady, and Winchester covers every segment. Import options from S&B, PMC, and Norma provide additional competition. Pricing has been stable since 2024, with match-grade loads showing the most price compression as competition in the precision segment has increased.
