## How .30-06 prices compare

The .30-06 Springfield is the original American do-everything rifle cartridge — it's been taking game on every continent since 1906 and remains one of the most popular deer rifle calibers in the U.S. The cartridge can push the same bullet weights as .308 Winchester 100–200 fps faster thanks to its longer case, though that advantage has become less relevant as .308-length actions now dominate the bolt-action market.

**FMJ range ammunition** is the narrowest segment because most .30-06 shooters are hunters, not high-volume range shooters. Federal American Eagle 150gr FMJ is the de facto training load at **$0.65–0.85 per round**. There are fewer bulk options than .308 or 5.56 — the caliber's heritage is bolt-action hunting, not semi-auto volume fire.

**Hunting ammunition** is where the .30-06 product line is deepest. Budget hunting loads — Remington Core-Lokt, Federal Power-Shok, Winchester Super-X — run **$0.80–1.20/rd** and use traditional cup-and-core soft point bullets that have been killing deer reliably for decades. The Remington Core-Lokt in particular has been in continuous production since 1939 and remains one of the best-selling hunting loads in America.

Premium hunting loads with modern controlled-expansion bullets — Hornady ELD-X, Nosler AccuBond, Federal Terminal Ascent — run **$1.10–2.00/rd** and offer better long-range accuracy and more consistent terminal performance on larger game like elk and moose. For deer-sized game inside 300 yards, the budget loads are genuinely hard to beat.

> **The .30-06 vs .308 question:** If .308 Winchester can do everything .30-06 can in a shorter, lighter action, why does the .30-06 persist? Three reasons: legacy rifles (there are millions of .30-06 bolt-actions in American gun safes), slight velocity advantage with heavy bullets (180gr+), and tradition. For a new rifle purchase, .308 Winchester offers better ammunition selection, shorter bolt throw, and lower ammo cost. For grandpa's pre-64 Model 70, the .30-06 remains exactly right.

### Market trends

The .30-06 market is stable but gradually declining in volume as new bolt-action rifle sales increasingly favor .308 Winchester and 6.5 Creedmoor. All major ammunition manufacturers continue full product lines, and pricing has been steady since 2024. The hunting segment is well-supplied heading into each fall season.
