## How .30-06 prices compare

The .30-06 Springfield is the classic American hunting cartridge, still one of the most popular deer rifle calibers. FMJ range ammo runs $0.65–0.85 per round — noticeably more than .308 Winchester for comparable performance due to the larger case. Hunting loads with expanding bullets run $0.80–1.50 per round. The .30-06 has a slight velocity advantage over .308 Winchester with the same bullet weights, but .308 has overtaken it in precision shooting due to better short-action efficiency. Hunting loads in Core-Lokt and Power-Shok are some of the most affordable expanding options.
