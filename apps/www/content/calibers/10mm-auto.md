## How 10mm Auto prices compare

The 10mm Auto is experiencing a resurgence driven by the woods carry and outdoor market. FMJ range ammo runs $0.35–0.55 per round — roughly 2x the cost of 9mm. JHP defense loads run $0.60–1.00 per round. Hard-cast flat-nose loads for bear country run $0.80–1.50 per round. Note that many "10mm" loads from major manufacturers are downloaded to essentially .40 S&W velocity — if you want full-power 10mm, look for Underwood, Buffalo Bore, Double Tap, or Sig V-Crown.
