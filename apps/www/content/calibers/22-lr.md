## How .22 LR prices compare

The .22 LR is the cheapest centerfire-equivalent ammo available by a wide margin, making it the go-to caliber for high-volume training and plinking. Bulk ammo runs $0.05–0.08 per round in 500+ round bricks. High-velocity hollow points run $0.07–0.12 per round. Match-grade target ammo (SK, Eley, Lapua) starts around $0.10 and can exceed $0.20 per round. The .22 LR market has fully normalized from the 2020–2022 shortage. Buy in bricks (500 rounds) or cases (5000 rounds) for best pricing.
