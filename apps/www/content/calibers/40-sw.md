## How .40 S&W prices compare

The .40 S&W was developed in 1990 as a compromise between 9mm and .45 ACP for law enforcement, and its pricing reflects an interesting market position: it's often cheaper than you'd expect because declining demand has created buyer-favorable conditions.

**FMJ range ammo** runs **$0.24—0.36 per round** — slightly more than 9mm but often less than .45 ACP. The standard range load is 180gr FMJ, though 165gr options exist. Blazer Brass and Federal American Eagle are the most common training options.

**JHP defense loads** run **$0.55—1.00 per round**, comparable to 9mm and .45 ACP defensive ammo. Federal HST and Speer Gold Dot in .40 S&W have extensive law enforcement track records — the .40 S&W was the dominant LE duty caliber from the mid-1990s through the mid-2010s.

> **The .40 S&W market shift:** Since the FBI's 2014 decision to return to 9mm, most law enforcement agencies have followed suit. This has created an unusual buyer's market for .40 S&W: used duty pistols (Glock 22, Glock 23, S&W M&P 40) are available at significant discounts, and ammunition manufacturers occasionally run promotions to move .40 S&W inventory. For budget-conscious shooters willing to accept sharper recoil and lower capacity, the .40 S&W platform offers genuine value.

### Market trends

The .40 S&W is in a slow, structural decline. New gun sales in the caliber decrease each year as 9mm dominates. However, the caliber is far from dead — millions of .40 S&W pistols are in circulation, and all major manufacturers continue full product lines. Pricing has actually improved for buyers as production capacity exceeds demand.
