## How .40 S&W prices compare

The .40 S&W sits between 9mm and .45 ACP in both performance and price. FMJ range ammo typically runs $0.25–0.38 per round. JHP defense loads run $0.55–0.90 per round. The caliber has been declining in popularity as LE agencies transition to 9mm (driven by FBI testing showing modern 9mm JHP matches .40 terminal performance with less recoil and more capacity). This declining demand means .40 S&W deals can be found as retailers clear inventory.
