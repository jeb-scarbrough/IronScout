## How 12 gauge prices compare

Shotshells are priced very differently from rifle and handgun ammo. Light target loads (#7.5–#8 shot) run $0.25–0.40 per shell and are the cheapest way to shoot a lot. Buckshot for defense (00 buck) runs $0.50–1.30 per shell depending on quality. Slugs run $0.70–1.50 each. Premium defensive buckshot like Federal FliteControl commands a significant premium for its tighter patterning. Volume shooters (trap/skeet) should buy by the case (10 boxes / 250 shells) for best pricing.
