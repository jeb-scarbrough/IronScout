## How 12 gauge prices compare

The 12 gauge market is unique among ammunition categories because the "caliber" encompasses an enormous range of applications: from $0.25 target loads to $2.00+ premium waterfowl shells. The price range is driven almost entirely by load type, shot material, and intended use.

**Target and trap loads** are the volume segment, running **$0.25—0.40 per shell**. Federal Top Gun and Winchester AA are the standard choices for clay shooting. Buying by the flat (10 boxes / 250 shells) reduces per-shell cost significantly. Competitive trap and skeet shooters burn through 200—500 shells per session, making price per shell the primary purchasing consideration.

**Buckshot for home defense** represents a different value equation. Federal FliteControl 00 Buck — widely considered the best-patterning buckshot available — runs **$0.80—1.20 per shell**. The FliteControl wad keeps the 9-pellet pattern significantly tighter than standard buckshot at indoor distances, which is why it's recommended by virtually every serious defensive shotgun instructor. A 5-round box costs $4—6, and most home defense shotguns hold 5—8 rounds, so equipping a shotgun with premium buckshot costs less than a box of premium 9mm JHP.

**Slugs** range from **$0.80 to $2.00+ per shell** depending on type. Foster-style rifled slugs for smoothbore shotguns are the budget option. Sabot slugs for rifled barrels offer dramatically better accuracy at the cost of higher per-shell price and barrel requirements.

> **Steel vs. lead vs. bismuth:** Federal regulations require non-toxic shot for waterfowl hunting. Steel shot is the cheapest non-toxic option but patterns differently than lead and has less energy at distance. Bismuth is ballistically closer to lead but costs 3—4x more per shell. For upland and target shooting where lead is legal, lead remains the standard.

### Market trends

The 12 gauge market is mature and well-supplied. Target load pricing has been stable, while premium defensive and hunting loads have seen slight price compression from increased competition. Non-toxic waterfowl ammunition continues to be the most expensive segment due to material costs.
