## How .45 ACP prices compare

The .45 ACP carries a meaningful per-round premium over 9mm due to the larger case, heavier bullet, and more raw material per cartridge. FMJ range ammunition in the standard 230gr loading runs **$0.28–0.40 per round** — roughly 50–60% more than equivalent 9mm FMJ. For shooters running a 1911, Glock 21, or HK USP regularly, this adds up quickly: a 200-round range session costs $56–80 in .45 ACP versus $34–50 in 9mm.

That said, .45 ACP has one inherent advantage: **every standard load is subsonic.** The 230gr FMJ at ~830 fps is well below the speed of sound, which means suppressed .45 ACP shooting requires no special ammunition. This makes standard FMJ range ammo double as suppressor ammo — something 9mm shooters have to buy dedicated subsonic loads to achieve.

Premium JHP defense loads run **$0.60–1.10 per round**, comparable to 9mm JHP pricing. Federal HST and Speer Gold Dot in .45 ACP are proven performers with extensive law enforcement track records. The debate between 185gr and 230gr JHP comes down to capacity and felt recoil: 185gr loads are faster and produce less felt recoil, while 230gr loads maximize the .45's traditional heavy-and-slow expansion profile.

> **The capacity tradeoff:** The reason 9mm has overtaken .45 ACP in law enforcement and military use isn't terminal ballistics — it's capacity. A full-size 9mm holds 15–17+ rounds versus 7–13 for .45 ACP. Modern 9mm JHP has closed the terminal performance gap significantly, making the capacity advantage decisive for duty use. For home defense and recreational shooting, .45 ACP remains a perfectly effective choice.

### Market trends

The .45 ACP market is stable but slowly declining in volume as 9mm continues to dominate new handgun sales. Pricing has been steady since 2024, with no significant supply disruptions. The caliber remains well-supported by all major manufacturers.
