## What to know

The 10mm auto splits into two defense categories: JHP for human threats and hard-cast for animal defense. JHP (V-Crown, HST) is designed for controlled expansion against soft targets. Hard-cast flat-nose (Underwood, Buffalo Bore) is designed for deep, straight-line penetration on bears and other large animals. Ensure your load is actually full-power 10mm — many mainstream loads are downloaded.
