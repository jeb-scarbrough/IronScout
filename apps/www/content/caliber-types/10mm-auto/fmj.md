## Best-value 10mm FMJ

| Product Line | Grain | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Federal American Eagle 10mm | 180gr | 50 | $0.35–0.50 |
| Blazer Brass 10mm | 180gr | 50 | $0.35–0.48 |
| S&B 10mm | 180gr | 50 | $0.35–0.48 |

## What to know

180gr FMJ is the standard 10mm range load. Many mainstream 10mm FMJ loads are "downloaded" to approximately .40 S&W velocity (~1,030 fps). For full-power 10mm range practice (to match your carry load recoil), look for loads advertised at 1,200+ fps. The 10mm costs roughly 2x the price of 9mm for training.
