## What to know

Target loads are the highest-volume shotshell category. Winchester AA is the premium competition standard; Federal Top Gun and Remington Gun Club are the value options. Light loads (1oz) are preferred for high-volume days — less recoil means less fatigue. Case pricing (250 shells) drops cost 10—15%. Many ranges and clubs offer bulk case discounts.
