## What to know

For clay shooting, #7.5 and #8 shot are standard. #7.5 has slightly larger pellets (better for trap at distance), #8 has more pellets (better for skeet at closer range). Buy by the case (10 boxes / 250 rounds) for best pricing. 1oz loads have less recoil than 1-1/8oz and are preferred for high-volume shooting.
