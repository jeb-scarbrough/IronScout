## What to know

00 Buck is the standard home defense shotgun load. Standard loads pattern 12–18" at 15 yards from a cylinder bore. Federal FliteControl patterns significantly tighter (6–8" at 15 yards) due to its wad design — worth the premium for home defense. The 2-3/4" length is standard; 3" magnum loads offer more pellets but much more recoil with minimal practical benefit at defensive distances.
