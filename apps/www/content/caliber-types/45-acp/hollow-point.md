## What to know about .45 ACP hollow points

The .45 ACP starts with a .452" bore — expansion from JHP creates a wound channel that's hard to match with smaller calibers. The HST in .45 ACP expands to roughly 1 inch. The 230gr loads are subsonic, which means they work exceptionally well suppressed with defense JHP. The 185gr options (Critical Defense) trade bullet weight for velocity, which can aid expansion from shorter barrels.
