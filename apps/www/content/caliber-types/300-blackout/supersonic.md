## What to know

Supersonic .300 BLK (110–150gr at 2,000–2,400 fps) offers ballistics similar to 7.62x39 from an AR-15 platform. FMJ supersonic is the cheapest way to run a .300 BLK. Note that supersonic loads through a suppressor will still produce a sonic crack — the suppressor only reduces muzzle blast.
