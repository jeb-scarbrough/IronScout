## What to know

Subsonic .300 BLK (below ~1,050 fps) is the primary reason most people choose this caliber — it's purpose-built for suppressed shooting. Hornady Sub-X is unique in that it actually expands at subsonic velocity; most JHP bullets won't expand below 1,000 fps. For range/suppressor fun, FMJ subsonic (Magtech, S&B) is the cheapest option.
