## What to know about subsonic .300 BLK

Subsonic .300 Blackout — loaded to velocities below approximately 1,050 fps — is purpose-built for suppressed shooting. When paired with a quality suppressor, subsonic .300 BLK produces a hearing-safe report with dramatically reduced concussion compared to supersonic loads. This is the primary use case that drives .300 BLK adoption.

### FMJ vs. expanding subsonic

The critical distinction in subsonic .300 BLK is between **FMJ plinking loads** and **expanding defense loads**. Standard hollow point bullets are designed to expand at velocities above 1,200 fps — at subsonic speeds (~1,000 fps), they behave like FMJ and pass straight through without expanding. This makes bullet selection extremely important for anyone using subsonic .300 BLK for home defense.

**Hornady Sub-X** is the standout expanding subsonic load. Its patented flex-tip design initiates expansion at subsonic velocity, something conventional JHP cannot reliably do. Lehigh Defense Controlled Chaos and Maximum Expansion bullets also offer subsonic expansion through non-traditional engineering (fragmenting or hydraulic designs).

For **range and suppressor fun**, FMJ subsonic loads from S&B and Magtech at $0.55—0.75/rd are the most economical option. Save the more expensive expanding loads for your defense magazine.

> **Cycling reliability:** Subsonic .300 BLK generates less gas than supersonic loads, which can cause cycling issues in some gas-operated semi-autos, particularly those with adjustable gas blocks set for supersonic ammo. If running a suppressed AR-15, ensure your gas system is tuned for subsonic or use a suppressor with back-pressure characteristics that aid cycling.
