## What to know

Expanding .300 BLK comes in two flavors: supersonic (110–125gr) for maximum terminal effect, and subsonic (190gr+ Sub-X) for suppressed use. Barnes TAC-TX is the most popular supersonic expanding load. Hornady Sub-X is the only widely available subsonic that reliably expands. Premium pricing reflects the specialty nature of these loads.
