## What to know

Steel-case HP in 7.62x39 is inexpensive but expansion is inconsistent. For serious defense or hunting use, Hornady SST and Federal Fusion offer reliable controlled expansion but at 2–3x the price. The 7.62x39's moderate velocity (~2,350 fps) means bullet selection matters more than with higher-velocity cartridges.
