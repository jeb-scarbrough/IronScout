## What to know

Steel-case is the default for 7.62x39 — it's significantly cheaper than brass-case options. Steel-case is fine for AK-pattern rifles and most bolt actions. Some indoor ranges prohibit steel-case or bi-metal jackets. Federal American Eagle brass-case is the go-to range-safe option at a premium. Post-2021 Russian import ban has affected supply of new Tula and Wolf stock.
