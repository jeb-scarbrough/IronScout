## Best-value .380 ACP FMJ

| Product Line | Grain | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blazer Brass .380 | 95gr | 50 | $0.22–0.30 |
| Federal American Eagle .380 | 95gr | 50 | $0.22–0.32 |
| Winchester White Box .380 | 95gr | 50 | $0.24–0.32 |

## What to know

95gr FMJ is the standard .380 range load. Despite being a smaller cartridge than 9mm, .380 costs more per round due to lower production volume. Practice with the same gun you carry — the micro-compact .380 pistols have snappy recoil that takes training to manage.
