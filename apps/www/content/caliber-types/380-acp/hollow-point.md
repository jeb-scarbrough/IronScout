## .380 ACP JHP options

| Product Line | Grain | Bullet | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Federal HST Micro | 99gr | JHP | 20 | $0.55–0.85 |
| Hornady Critical Defense .380 | 90gr | FTX | 25 | $0.60–0.90 |
| Sig V-Crown .380 | 90gr | JHP | 20 | $0.50–0.75 |

## What to know

.380 JHP must expand reliably from short barrels (typically 2.8–3.5") at relatively low velocity (~950 fps). Federal HST Micro and Hornady Critical Defense are specifically engineered for this challenge. Expansion is less dramatic than 9mm JHP due to lower velocity. The FTX polymer tip in Critical Defense prevents the hollow point from clogging through clothing.
