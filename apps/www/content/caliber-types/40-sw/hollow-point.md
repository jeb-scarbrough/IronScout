## .40 S&W JHP options

| Product Line | Grain | Bullet | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Federal HST .40 | 180gr | JHP | 50 | $0.55–0.85 |

## What to know

The .40 S&W JHP benefits from larger bullet diameter (.400") than 9mm (.355"), creating wider expansion. The FBI originally adopted the .40 S&W but has since transitioned back to 9mm, concluding that modern 9mm JHP closes the performance gap with less recoil and more capacity. If you carry a .40, HST and Gold Dot are proven performers with extensive LE track records.
