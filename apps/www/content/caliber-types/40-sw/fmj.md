## Best-value .40 S&W FMJ

| Product Line | Grain | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blazer Brass .40 | 180gr | 50 | $0.25–0.35 |
| Federal American Eagle .40 | 180gr | 50 | $0.25–0.38 |

## What to know

180gr FMJ is the most common .40 S&W range load, though 165gr is also popular. Declining popularity means .40 S&W sometimes goes on clearance sales as retailers reduce inventory — watch for deals. The .40 S&W has more recoil than 9mm but less than .45 ACP.
