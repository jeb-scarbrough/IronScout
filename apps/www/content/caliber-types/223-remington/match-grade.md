|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Hornady Black](/ammo/hornady-black-223) | 75gr | BTHP | 20 | $0.55–0.75 |

## What to know

Heavy-bullet .223 (69–77gr) requires 1:7 or 1:8 twist barrels. The .223 Remington headstamp is more common on match ammo than 5.56 NATO since precision loads are manufactured to SAAMI spec. See also [5.56 match grade](/caliber/556-nato/match-grade) for 77gr options.
