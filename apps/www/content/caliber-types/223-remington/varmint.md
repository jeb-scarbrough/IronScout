## What to know

Varmint bullets are designed for rapid, explosive expansion on small game (prairie dogs, groundhogs, coyotes). The Hornady V-Max is the standard with its polymer tip initiating expansion. These bullets are not suitable for barriers or self-defense — they fragment rather than penetrate.
