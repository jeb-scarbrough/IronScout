## What to know

The 140gr ELD-M and Sierra MatchKing are the two dominant match bullets for 6.5 Creedmoor. Both deliver sub-0.5 MOA from quality rifles. The ELD-M's heat-resistant tip maintains BC better at high velocity. The 6.5CM was designed from the ground up for competitive shooting and has largely replaced .308 in PRS-style competition.
