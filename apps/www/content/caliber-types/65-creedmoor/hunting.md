## What to know

The 6.5 Creedmoor is effective on deer, elk, and similar game with proper bullet selection. The Hornady ELD-X is the most popular hunting choice, designed for controlled expansion at both close and extended range. Federal Fusion is a budget option that works well inside 300 yards. The 6.5CM's mild recoil and flat trajectory make it forgiving for shots at uncertain distances.
