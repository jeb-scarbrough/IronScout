## What to know about 5.56 match ammo

Heavy-bullet 5.56 (75–77gr) requires a 1:7 or 1:8 twist barrel to stabilize properly. The 77gr Sierra MatchKing (SMK) is the gold standard — it's the bullet used in the Mk 262 military precision round. These loads are 2–3x the cost of ball ammo but deliver sub-MOA accuracy from quality barrels. The heavier bullets also retain energy better at distance than 55gr M193.
