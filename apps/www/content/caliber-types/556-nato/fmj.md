## What to know about 5.56 FMJ

M193 (55gr FMJ at ~3,165 fps) is the standard 5.56 ball load. All options listed above meet or exceed mil-spec velocity and accuracy standards. Wolf Gold .223 is technically .223 Remington but performs identically in 5.56 chambers. PMC X-TAC is often the cheapest mil-spec option in case quantity.
