## What to know about M855 green tip

M855 uses a 62gr bullet with a mild steel penetrator tip (painted green for identification). It was designed for the M249 SAW and M16A2 with 1:7 twist barrels. The steel core means M855 is banned at most indoor ranges and some outdoor ranges. M855 is not "armor piercing" under federal law (ATF classification), but it does penetrate soft barriers better than M193. Price is typically $0.02–0.04 more per round than M193.
