| Product Line | Grain | Bullet | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Federal Gold Medal .30-06 | 168gr | Sierra MK | 20 | $1.00–1.40 |

## What to know

Match .30-06 is a niche category — most precision shooters have moved to .308 Win or 6.5 Creedmoor. Options are limited and expensive. The .30-06's long action and larger case offer no practical accuracy advantage over short-action cartridges for match use. If you're shooting a .30-06 in competition (CMP, Garand matches), Federal Gold Medal is the standard.
