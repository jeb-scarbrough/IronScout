## What to know

The .30-06 is the classic American deer cartridge with over a century of hunting heritage. The 150gr soft point (Power-Shok, Core-Lokt) is the traditional deer load — affordable and effective inside 300 yards. For longer range or tougher game, premium bullets like the ELD-X provide better retained weight and controlled expansion. The .30-06 handles bullet weights from 125gr to 220gr, making it one of the most versatile hunting cartridges.
