## Best-value .30-06 FMJ

| Product Line | Grain | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Federal American Eagle .30-06 | 150gr | 20 | $0.65–0.85 |
| PPU .30-06 | 150gr | 20 | $0.60–0.80 |
| S&B .30-06 | 150gr | 20 | $0.60–0.80 |

## What to know

.30-06 FMJ is less commonly stocked than .308 FMJ due to lower demand. PPU (Prvi Partizan) and S&B (Sellier & Bellot) from Europe are often the best value. Federal American Eagle is the main domestic option. The .30-06 costs more per round than .308 for similar ballistics due to the larger case.
