## What to know about 9mm subsonic

Any 9mm load with a 147gr bullet is subsonic out of most barrel lengths (below ~1,050 fps). This makes standard 147gr FMJ an affordable suppressor option — no need for specifically "subsonic" labeled ammo. The 115gr and 124gr standard loads are supersonic and will produce a sonic crack even through a suppressor. For suppressed defensive use, 147gr JHP (HST, Gold Dot) combines suppressor compatibility with reliable expansion.
