## What to know about 9mm +P

The +P designation means the load is loaded to approximately 10% higher pressure than standard 9mm (38,500 PSI vs 35,000 PSI SAAMI). This translates to 50–100 fps higher velocity. Most modern 9mm pistols are rated for +P ammunition, but check your owner's manual. The velocity advantage provides slightly more reliable expansion, especially from shorter barrels. +P loads cost a small premium over standard pressure — typically $0.03–0.05 more per round.
