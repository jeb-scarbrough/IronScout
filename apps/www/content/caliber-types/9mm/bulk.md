## Buying 9mm in bulk

Buying 500–1000 rounds at a time typically saves 10–15% versus 50-round boxes. Most retailers offer free shipping over a certain threshold ($100–$200), which effectively adds another 5–8% savings. The sweet spot for most shooters is 1000 rounds — large enough for meaningful savings, small enough to not tie up too much cash. Watch for holiday sales (Memorial Day, July 4th, Black Friday) when retailers run bulk ammo promotions.
