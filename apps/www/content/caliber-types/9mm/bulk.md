## Why buy 9mm in bulk

The 9mm FMJ market is the single best caliber for bulk buying. The sheer production volume means manufacturers offer aggressive pricing on large count boxes and cases, and retailers frequently run promotions on case quantities.

### Typical savings by quantity

- **200–250 rounds:** 5–8% savings over 50-round boxes. A single range session's worth of ammo.
- **500 rounds:** 10–12% savings. The sweet spot for most shooters — meaningful savings without a large upfront commitment.
- **1,000 rounds:** 12–15% savings. The standard case quantity. At current pricing, a case runs $150–200.
- **2,000+ rounds:** Marginal additional savings beyond 1,000. Buy this much only if you have proper storage.

> **Shipping is the hidden variable.** A $0.17/rd deal with $15 shipping on 500 rounds is effectively $0.20/rd. Most major retailers (Palmetto State Armory, Brownells, Midway USA) offer free shipping above $99–$150. Time your bulk purchases to exceed the free shipping threshold for true lowest cost.

### When to buy

Holiday sales — Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Black Friday — produce the year's best pricing on bulk 9mm. Set a price alert and be ready to buy when the price drops below your target. Outside of promotional periods, pricing is remarkably stable, so there's no penalty for buying when you need it.

### Storage considerations

Ammunition stored properly lasts decades. Keep bulk 9mm in a cool, dry location — a closet or gun safe is fine. Avoid garages and outdoor sheds where temperature and humidity extremes accelerate degradation. Ammo cans with desiccant packs are ideal for long-term storage.
