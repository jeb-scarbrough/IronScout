## What to know about 9mm JHP

Self-defense ammunition is not a commodity product like FMJ range ammo. Bullet design, bonding, and expansion characteristics vary dramatically between manufacturers and affect real-world terminal performance. The three most-carried duty loads by law enforcement — **Federal HST, Speer Gold Dot, and Hornady Critical Duty** — have extensive track records across thousands of documented incidents.

### Bonded vs. non-bonded

**Bonded bullets** (HST, Gold Dot, Critical Duty FlexLock) have the jacket chemically or mechanically locked to the core, which prevents separation during barrier penetration (auto glass, drywall, heavy clothing). Bonded loads are standard for law enforcement duty use.

**Non-bonded bullets** (Hornady Critical Defense FTX, Federal Punch) are designed for consistent expansion through light clothing but may not hold together through intermediate barriers. For everyday concealed carry where barrier penetration is less of a concern, non-bonded loads work well and are often less expensive.

### Standard pressure vs. +P

Standard-pressure 9mm JHP is adequate for self-defense in any modern 9mm pistol. +P loads add 50—100 fps of velocity, which can improve expansion reliability in shorter barrels (3" and under). The tradeoff is increased muzzle flash, recoil, and accelerated wear. For full-size and compact pistols, standard pressure is the recommended starting point.

> **How much to buy:** Defense ammo is carried, not consumed in volume. A typical purchase is 2—3 boxes: one to function-test in your carry gun (ensure reliable feeding), one or two for carry rotation. Replace carry ammo annually. Total annual cost for carry ammo: $20—50.
