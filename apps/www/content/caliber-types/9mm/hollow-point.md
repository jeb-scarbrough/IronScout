## What to know about 9mm hollow points

Not all JHP is equal. Federal HST and Speer Gold Dot are the two most-carried LE rounds and have extensive barrier-blind testing. Hornady Critical Defense is designed for short-barrel carry guns. Critical Duty is for full-size duty guns and passes FBI barrier protocol. Sig V-Crown often undercuts the premium brands on price. Look for 50-round LE boxes (HST, Gold Dot) rather than 20–25 round retail boxes for significantly better per-round cost.
