## What to know about 9mm FMJ

The **115gr FMJ** is the universal 9mm range load. Every major manufacturer produces one, and the performance differences between brands at typical training distances are negligible. This is a commodity product — buy on price and availability.

**Brass-cased ammunition is the standard** and is accepted at all indoor and outdoor ranges. Brass is also reloadable, which matters if you reload or sell your brass. Some indoor ranges prohibit steel-cased ammo and/or bi-metal jackets, so brass-case FMJ is the universally safe choice.

### 115gr vs 124gr vs 147gr FMJ

Most range FMJ is 115gr, but 124gr and 147gr options exist. If your carry ammo is 124gr or 147gr JHP, practicing with the same weight FMJ gives you a closer feel for recoil and point of impact. However, the cost savings of 115gr versus heavier weights is typically minimal ($0.01—0.02/rd), so this is a training philosophy choice more than a budget decision.

### Buying in bulk

The 9mm FMJ market rewards bulk buying more than any other caliber. Common quantity breaks and approximate savings versus 50-round box pricing:

- **200—250 rounds:** 5—8% savings, good for a single range session
- **500 rounds:** 10—12% savings, the sweet spot for most shooters
- **1,000 rounds:** 12—15% savings, the standard case quantity

> **Watch shipping costs.** A $0.17/rd deal that adds $15 shipping on 500 rounds effectively costs $0.20/rd. Most major retailers offer free shipping above $99—$150, which aligns naturally with 500+ round orders.
