## What to know about 9mm FMJ

The 115gr FMJ is the standard 9mm range load. Virtually all major manufacturers make one, and pricing is competitive. Brass-cased ammo is preferred because it's reloadable and accepted at all ranges — some indoor ranges prohibit steel-cased ammo. The price difference between brands is often just $0.01–0.03 per round, so availability and shipping costs matter as much as sticker price. Buying 500+ rounds at once typically saves 10–15% versus 50-round boxes.
