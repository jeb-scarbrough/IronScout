## Buying .22 LR in bulk

.22 LR is sold in "bricks" (500 rounds) and "cases" (5,000–6,300 rounds). The 525-round CCI Blazer brick is the most common bulk format. For high-volume shooting, the 5,250-round case drops per-round cost to as low as $0.04. Shipping is cheap since .22 LR is lightweight — a case weighs about 15 lbs.
