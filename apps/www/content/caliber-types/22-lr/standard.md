## Best-value .22 LR standard

| Product Line | Grain | Bullet | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [CCI Blazer](/ammo/cci-blazer-22lr) | 40gr | LRN | 50–5250 | $0.04–0.07 |
| [Federal AutoMatch](/ammo/federal-automatch-22lr) | 40gr | LRN | 325 | $0.05–0.07 |
| [Federal Champion](/ammo/federal-champion-22lr) | 40gr | LRN | 325–525 | $0.05–0.07 |

## What to know

Standard velocity .22 LR (1,050–1,080 fps) is the quietest and cheapest option. Buy in 500-round bricks or 5,000-round cases for best pricing. AutoMatch is specifically optimized for semi-auto cycling. CCI Blazer is the cheapest but may not cycle all semi-autos reliably.
