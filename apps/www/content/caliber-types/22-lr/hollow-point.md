## What to know

CCI Mini-Mag CPHP is the best all-around .22 HP — reliable cycling, good expansion, reasonable price. CCI Stinger and Velocitor are hyper-velocity options for maximum terminal effect on small game. Federal Punch is a new entry designed specifically for self-defense from .22 carry guns. For varmint use, the higher velocity options fragment and expand more reliably.
