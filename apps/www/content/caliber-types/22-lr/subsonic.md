## .22 LR subsonic options

| Product Line | Grain | Velocity | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CCI Standard Velocity | 40gr | 1070 fps | 50—500 | $0.07—0.09 |
| CCI Quiet-22 | 40gr | 710 fps | 50 | $0.08—0.12 |

## What to know

CCI Standard Velocity (1,070 fps) is technically subsonic and the most popular choice for suppressed .22 LR. CCI Quiet-22 (710 fps) and Aguila Colibri (420 fps) are extremely quiet but won't cycle semi-autos. CCI Suppressor (45gr at 970 fps) is specifically designed for suppressed semi-autos. Most standard velocity .22 LR is inherently subsonic — you don't need specially labeled "subsonic" ammo.
