## What to know

The 168gr Sierra MatchKing (GMM) is the standard by which all .308 match ammo is judged. The 175gr extends effective range past 800 yards where the 168gr can become unstable. Hornady ELD Match uses a heat-resistant polymer tip for more consistent BC at long range. Match .308 runs 2x the cost of FMJ.
