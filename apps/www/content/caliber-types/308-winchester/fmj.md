|---|---|---|---|
| Federal American Eagle | 150gr | 20 | $0.55—0.75 |
| Winchester White Box | 147gr | 20 | $0.55—0.70 |
| Federal Lake City XM80 | 149gr | 20—500 | $0.55—0.70 |

## What to know

The 147—150gr FMJ is the standard .308 range load. Lake City XM80 (7.62 NATO mil-spec) is often the cheapest option in bulk. Brass-cased and reloadable. Buying in 200+ round quantities saves noticeably.
