## .308 hunting options

| Product Line | Grain | Bullet | Count | Typical CPR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Federal Power-Shok](/ammo/federal-power-shok-308) | 150gr | Soft Point | 20 | $0.75—1.00 |
| Hornady American Whitetail | 150gr | InterLock | 20 | $0.80—1.10 |
| Remington Core-Lokt | 150gr | PSP | 20 | $0.80—1.10 |

## What to know

For whitetail at typical ranges (under 300 yards), budget soft points like Power-Shok and Core-Lokt work fine and cost half as much as premium options. For longer shots or tougher game, bonded bullets (Terminal Ascent, Accubond) retain more weight. The 150gr is the most popular hunting weight for .308.
