## About Wolf 7.62x39

Wolf Performance Ammunition is a US-based brand that sources from various manufacturers. The 7.62x39 line was historically Russian-made (Barnaul, Ulyanovsk) and is affected by the 2021 Russian import ban. Current stock is remaining inventory. Steel-cased, polymer-coated, Berdan-primed (not reloadable). When available, it's interchangeable with Tula in price and quality for AK/SKS shooters.
