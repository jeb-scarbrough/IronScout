## About Federal HST .45 ACP

The .45 ACP HST delivers the same expansion reliability as the 9mm version in a larger bore. The 230gr standard pressure load is preferred for most carry guns. The .45 ACP HST is already subsonic at standard pressure (around 890 fps), making it naturally suppressor-friendly. The 50-round LE boxes are significantly cheaper per round than 20-round retail packaging.
