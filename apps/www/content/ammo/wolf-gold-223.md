## About Wolf Gold .223

Despite the Wolf branding, Wolf Gold is not Russian-made — it's manufactured in Taiwan by a different company than the steel-cased Wolf line. Brass-cased, boxer-primed, and reloadable. Consistently one of the cheapest brass-cased .223 loads on the market. The 1000-round cases are extremely popular with budget-conscious AR shooters. Not affected by the Russian ammo import ban since it's Taiwanese.
