## About Hornady Critical Duty 9mm

The Critical Duty is designed for full-size duty pistols and meets the FBI protocol barrier penetration requirements. The FlexLock bullet has a polymer tip like the Critical Defense but uses a heavier 135gr bullet with an InterLock band to prevent jacket-core separation. The +P version is carried by many LE agencies. Distinguished from Critical Defense by the red tip (vs orange) and intended use in full-size rather than compact pistols.
