## About Remington UMC 9mm

Remington UMC (Union Metallic Cartridge) is one of the oldest ammunition brands in America. The 9mm FMJ line is a reliable, widely available range option. Brass-cased and reloadable. The 250-round mega pack offers the best per-round value. Remington went through bankruptcy in 2020 and was acquired by Vista Outdoor — production has stabilized and availability has improved.
