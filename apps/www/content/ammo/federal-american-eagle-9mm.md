## About Federal American Eagle 9mm

Federal American Eagle is the go-to range and training ammo for most 9mm shooters. Brass-cased, boxer-primed, and reloadable. The 115gr FMJ (AE9DP) is the most common configuration and one of the most widely available 9mm loads in the US. Consistent quality from Federal's Anoka, MN facility. The 100-round value packs offer better per-round pricing than 50-round boxes.
