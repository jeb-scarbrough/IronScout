## About Federal HST 9mm

The HST is the most widely carried law enforcement handgun round in the US. Known for consistent expansion through heavy clothing barriers without plugging. The 124gr standard pressure load (P9HST1) is the most popular configuration. The "LE" and "Personal Defense" retail versions use the same bullet and load — only packaging differs. The 50-round LE boxes are significantly cheaper per round than 20-round retail boxes.
