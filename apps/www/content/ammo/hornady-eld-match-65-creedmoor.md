## About Hornady ELD Match 6.5 Creedmoor

The Hornady ELD Match is arguably the standard factory match load for 6.5 Creedmoor. The ELD-M (Extremely Low Drag Match) bullet uses a heat-resistant polymer tip that maintains its BC better than traditional tips. The 140gr is the most popular weight and performs excellently to 1000+ yards. Hornady developed the 6.5 Creedmoor cartridge in partnership with Creedmoor Sports, making them the de facto authority on loading it.
