## About CCI Blazer .22 LR

CCI Blazer is the no-frills bulk plinking option from CCI. Lead round nose at standard velocity. The 525-round bricks are the most common purchase size and frequently available under $0.06/rd. The 5250-round case is the best per-round value. Not as reliable in semi-autos as Mini-Mag (expect occasional failures to cycle in picky guns), but fine for revolvers, bolt actions, and most semi-auto rifles.
