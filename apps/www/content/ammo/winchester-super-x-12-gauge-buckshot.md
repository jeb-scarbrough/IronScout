## About Winchester Super-X 12 Gauge Buckshot

Winchester Super-X is the standard-issue buckshot for home defense and deer hunting. The 2-3/4" 00 Buck (XB1200) with 9 pellets is the most common defensive shotgun load in America. The 15-round value pack (XB1200VP) offers better per-shell pricing. Patterns well from most cylinder-bore and improved cylinder barrels at typical defensive distances (7-15 yards).
