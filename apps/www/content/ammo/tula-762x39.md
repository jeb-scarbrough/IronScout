## About Tula 7.62x39

Tula is manufactured at the Tula Cartridge Works in Russia and was one of the most popular budget AK/SKS ammo brands. Steel-cased with lacquer or polymer coating, Berdan-primed (not reloadable). Note: Russian ammo imports were banned by the US State Department in September 2021. Current supply is remaining inventory only — prices may vary based on availability. When available, Tula remains one of the cheapest 7.62x39 options.
