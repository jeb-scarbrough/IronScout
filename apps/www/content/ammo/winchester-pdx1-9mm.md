## About Winchester PDX1 9mm

The PDX1 Defender uses a bonded jacketed hollow point designed to maintain weight retention through barriers. Previously known as the Winchester Ranger T-Series in LE packaging. The bonding process prevents jacket-core separation. Available primarily in 20-round retail boxes. The 124gr +P is the more popular configuration for carry use.
