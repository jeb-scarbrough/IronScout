## About Federal Top Gun 12 Gauge

Federal Top Gun is the standard target load for trap and skeet shooters. 2-3/4" shells with #7.5 or #8 shot. Clean-burning powder and consistent patterns. The 1oz "light" loads (TGL series) have less felt recoil and are preferred for high-volume clay shooting. Buy by the case (10 boxes / 250 shells) for the best per-shell pricing.
