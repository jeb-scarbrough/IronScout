## About Speer Gold Dot 9mm

The Gold Dot is a bonded-core JHP that has been a standard LE duty round for decades. The bonding process fuses the jacket to the core, preventing separation on impact. The 124gr standard pressure (53618) is the most common configuration. Gold Dot G2 is the newer version with a filled cavity design, though the original remains more widely available and cheaper.
