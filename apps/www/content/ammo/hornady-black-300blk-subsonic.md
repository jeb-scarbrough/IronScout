## About Hornady Black .300 BLK Subsonic

Hornady's Sub-X (Subsonic eXpanding) is designed to expand reliably at subsonic velocities — a challenge most hollow points fail at below 1000 fps. The 190gr bullet at approximately 1,050 fps is purpose-built for suppressed .300 Blackout. The polymer tip initiates expansion and the long-range cannelure holds the core together. The 200-round case offers significant savings over 20-round boxes.
