## About Sig V-Crown 9mm

The Sig V-Crown is a stacked hollow point design that provides reliable expansion across a wide velocity range. Often priced lower than Federal HST and Speer Gold Dot, making it a value pick for carry ammo. Available in 50-round boxes (unlike most defense ammo that comes in 20- or 25-round boxes), which significantly reduces the per-round cost. Manufactured at Sig's Jacksonville, AR facility.
