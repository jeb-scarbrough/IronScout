## About Hornady Critical Defense 9mm

The Critical Defense uses Hornady's FTX bullet with a polymer tip that prevents hollow point clogging through heavy clothing. Designed specifically for civilian concealed carry with shorter barrels. Nickel-plated cases for reliable feeding and visibility in low light. The 115gr weight provides higher velocity from compact pistols than heavier bullets. Available only in 25-round boxes — per-round cost is higher than LE-packaged alternatives like HST and Gold Dot.
