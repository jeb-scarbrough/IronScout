## About Blazer Brass 9mm

Blazer Brass is CCI's budget range line and consistently one of the cheapest brass-cased 9mm options available. Brass-cased and boxer-primed (reloadable), unlike the aluminum-cased Blazer line. The 200-round range bucket (52021) and 100-round value packs are the most economical way to buy. Manufactured at CCI's Lewiston, Idaho facility. Reliable and clean-shooting for the price.
