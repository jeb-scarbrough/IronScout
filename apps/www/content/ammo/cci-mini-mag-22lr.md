## About CCI Mini-Mag .22 LR

The CCI Mini-Mag is the gold standard for reliable .22 LR semi-auto cycling. The 36gr copper-plated hollow point (CPHP) at 1260 fps feeds reliably in virtually every .22 semi-auto including notoriously picky pistols like the Walther PPK/S .22. The 40gr round nose version is slightly slower but equally reliable. More expensive than bulk .22 LR but the reliability premium is worth it for semi-autos.
