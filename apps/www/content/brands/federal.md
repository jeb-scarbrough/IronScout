## How IronScout matches listings
We normalize listing text into canonical products using brand, caliber, grain weight, and round count. If details are missing, results may be limited. We do not recommend, rank, or score deals.

## Compare in store
If you are standing in a store, use the In-Store Price Check and enter the box details. This compares to recent online listings for context only.
